  <p>Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish. *Insistently* Bow ties are cool! Come on Amy, I'm a normal bloke, tell me what normal blokes do! They're not aliens, they're Earth... liens!</p>
  <p>You hit me with a cricket bat. I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me! *Insistently* Bow ties are cool! Come on Amy, I'm a normal bloke, tell me what normal blokes do!</p>

  <p>You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas? I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's aunt. *catches himself* And that is not how I'm introducing myself. Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today.</p>
  <p>Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff. All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong? No... It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness.</p>
  <p>Saving the world with meals on wheels. I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in. It's art! A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful?'! Annihilate? No. No violence. I won't stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?! I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you?</p>
  <p>They're not aliens, they're Earth…liens! You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME! It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool. You hit me with a cricket bat.</p>
  <p>Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff. Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time! No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness. I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship.</p>

  <p>*Insistently* Bow ties are cool! Come on Amy, I'm a normal bloke, tell me what normal blokes do! No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot. Call me the Rotmeister. No, I'm the Doctor. Don't call me the Rotmeister.</p>
